    Get centroids and samples for every cluster for a specific k (n_clusters).
    If collect_random = True the selection of the samples is done by selecting half of the n_samples randomly,

    Otherwise if collect_random = False the selection of the samples is done only by incrementing distance.
    Note that some clusters might have less that n_samples elements, and so the function will return the
    amout of elements that the cluster have.

    Parameters:
    k (int): The number of clusters
    kmeans (KMeans): The KMeans object that divided the images in clusters
    X (ndarray): The arrays (n_samples, n_features) that kmeans fitted in clusters
    image_names (list): The list of image's names in the same order of X
    n_samples (int): The number of samples to collect
    collect_random (bool): If the selection of samples have to include random points (default False)
