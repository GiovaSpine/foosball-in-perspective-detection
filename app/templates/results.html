    <h2>Performance Evaluation</h2>

    <p>
        Although the evaluation reports extremely high performance values, 
        a closer analysis reveals that these metrics alone do not portray
        the generalization capabilities of the model.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>precision(B): 0.9976</li>
        <li>recall(B): 0.9999</li>
        <li>mAP50(B): 0.9950</li>
        <li>mAP50-95(B): 0.9279</li>
        <li>precision(P): 0.9976</li>
        <li>recall(P): 0.9999</li>
        <li>mAP50(P): 0.9950</li>
        <li>mAP50-95(P): 0.9934</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Despite these near-perfect numerical results, a visual inspection of the
        model predictions highlights clear limitations in its ability to generalize to
        unseen scenarios. We can see some examples below.

    <p>
        This discrepancy is likely caused by the limited size and diversity of the training dataset.
        The task involves a wide range of different tables, configurations, camera lenses,
        viewpoints, lighting conditions, and occlusions, which are not sufficiently
        represented in the available data.
        As a result YOLO might be too complex for the dataset, overfitting the training data.
    </p>

    <p>
        Evidence of overfitting can also be observed during training, where the
        pose loss on the training set converges to approximately 0.01, while the
        validation pose loss, around 0.1, indicating a tenfold increase.
        This gap suggests that the model has learned to fit the training samples
        very accurately but struggles to generalize beyond them.
